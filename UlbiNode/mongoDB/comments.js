    In summary:
    MongoDB is the open-source database software 
    that can be self-hosted.

    MongoDB Atlas
    is a fully managed cloud version of MongoDB that abstracts away 
    the operational tasks associated with database management, 
    making it easier to use and scale.
    If you're looking for a hassle-free, cloud-based solution,
    MongoDB Atlas is a great option. If you need complete 
    control over your database environment and prefer managing 
    it yourself, then self-hosting MongoDB could be more suitable.
